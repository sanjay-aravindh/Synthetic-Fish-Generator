# Synthetic-Fish-Generator
A minimalist PyTorch implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed to synthesize 28x28 grayscale images. Features a fully connected architecture with binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimization. Ideal for learning GAN fundamentals, architectural prototyping, or generating synthetic biological silhouettes from latent noise.
