# Synthetic-Fish-Generator
A clean, single-file implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) built with PyTorch. This project demonstrates the adversarial training process where a generator learns to create realistic images (initially targeted for fish-like silhouettes) while a discriminator learns to distinguish between real and synthetic data.🚀 OverviewThe architecture follows the classic GAN framework:Generator: Takes a 100-dimensional noise vector ($z$) and maps it to a $28 \times 28$ image space using a series of Linear layers and Tanh activation.Discriminator: A binary classifier that evaluates images, outputting a probability (0 to 1) using Sigmoid activation to determine if an image is "real" or "fake."🛠️ FeaturesDevice Agnostic: Automatically detects and utilizes NVIDIA CUDA GPUs or defaults to CPU.Adversarial Training: Implements the minimax game using BCELoss (Binary Cross Entropy).Visualization: Uses Matplotlib to scale and save generated samples from the $[-1, 1]$ Tanh range to a viewable $[0, 1]$ grayscale image.📋 PrerequisitesBashpip install torch numpy matplotlib
🏃 UsageClone the repository.Run the script:Bashpython IFISH1.py
The training loop will run for 100 epochs, and the final generated sample will be saved as generated_fish.png.🔬 Mathematical ContextThe training objective follows the standard GAN value function $V(D, G)$:$$\min_{G} \max_{D} V(D, G) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}(x)}[\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_{z}(z)}[\log(1 - D(G(z)))]$$$D(x)$ is the Discriminator's estimate of the probability that real data $x$ is real.$G(z)$ is the Generator's output when given noise $z$.
